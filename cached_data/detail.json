Cecelia, a kind young girl, is tasked to fulfill this role; however, this tiresome job quickly exhausts her. That, paired with her hidden somnolent nature, often causes her to laze around the church.

While Cecelia sleeps in anticipation for her next visitor, Lawrence caters to her needs alongside performing the church's numerous responsibilities.\r\nSlowly but surely, they begin to form a comfortable and trusting friendship with one another. Lawrence accepting Cecelia's lax nature elates her while she grows accustomed to Lawrence's overly-doting nature. However, as the adoring and absent-minded saint's feelings for the dense and overly protective pastor progress past friendship, how will he respond? ",
